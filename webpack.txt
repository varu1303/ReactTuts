Webpack!

--------- WAY MORE JS CODE NOW ! SO THE NEED AROSE. --------

Earlier:

index.html

include all the dependencies using script tags.

NOW:

all our code - src/ directory
all dependencies - node_modules 

everything get combined into one bundle.js which is used in index.js! Webpack creates a
graph of dependencies and include in bundle.js accordingly.

------------------------ + and - ------------------------------


- helps mangage JS appications.
- adding script tags makes app slow, hard to manage, can run into errors
- use ES6 import - exports to break our code in their own islands
- Also dependencies can be downloaded by npm and integrated with app using bundler apps!

--------------------- STEPS -----------------------------------
1) npm init

2) npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react babel-plugin-transform-class-properties webpack webpack-cli

	-> install babel cli and presets to be able to transpile code (default parameters plugin also)


3) .babelrc

{
  "presets": [
    "env",
    "react"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "transform-class-properties"
  ]
}

4) .webpack.config.json 

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js",
    path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist')
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

5) Adding script tag in package.json for webpack!

	Webpack will take care of babel's operations as well.

"dev-build": "webpack --mode development --watch"

6) Install npm package React and ReactDOM

npm install react react-dom webpack
